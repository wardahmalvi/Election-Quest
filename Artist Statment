For my capstone project I have created a game titled, Election Quest: Time Travel Tango. Based on the 92 election cycle, this game is an homage to the retro computer games of the past. 
The intent of the game is to immerse the player in a time gone by, to learn historical facts about the 92 election, and to immerse players within that time period. 
I believe games are fun and are for everyone, as is history, and so it is my hope to mesh both in an exciting hands on experience.
I hope to create games similar to Election Quest in the future to combine history and art to create an experience worth learning about.
