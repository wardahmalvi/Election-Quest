Wardah Alvi is an artist who is fascinated by interdisciplinary outcomes. 
Her interests lie in using art, code, and the creation of soundtracks to create games that are also based on historical events. 
Wardah hopes to use her games to convey the relevance of history, as well as the ways in which history can be informational and entertaining. 
She is motivated by her background and personality and is always trying to find ways to implement both in her work. 
Her current project is using research that she did over the summer on the elections of 91-92.
