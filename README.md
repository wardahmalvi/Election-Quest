# Election-Quest


My capstone project git for CRCP5301 


Each folder contains a specific element of the game. 


The code is hosted on the AGS editor itself but is uploaded to Itch.io and can be downloaded there.

A limitation of AGS is that the games made on it are for Windows users.


The game art was created using Pixilart.com and so the pixil files can be edited using the website. 


AGS uses Java and C# as a scripting language.


The music in the game was used with due credit given.


# Artist Bio
Wardah Alvi is an artist who is fascinated by interdisciplinary outcomes. 
Her interests lie in using art, code, and the creation of soundtracks to create games that are also based on historical events. 
Wardah hopes to use her games to convey the relevance of history, as well as the ways in which history can be informational and entertaining. 
She is motivated by her background and personality and is always trying to find ways to implement both in her work. 
Her current project is using research that she did over the summer on the elections of 91-92.


# Artist Statement

For my capstone project I have created a game titled, Elections R U.S. Based on the 92 election cycle, this game is an homage to the retro computer games of the past. 
The intent of the game is to immerse the player in a time gone by, to learn historical facts about the 92 election, and to immerse players within that time period. 
I believe games are fun and are for everyone, as is history, and so it is my hope to mesh both in an exciting hands on experience.
I hope to create similar games in the future to combine history and art to create an experience worth learning about. 

# Game blurb: 
Welcome! 

You are playing as Roberto,  an intern for the 3rd Presidential Debate that is taking place at Michigan State University on October 19th, 1992. 

There are only a few hours left until the debate starts and most of the setup is done.  


Hopefully, everything goes smoothly...
