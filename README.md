# Election-Quest
My capstone project git for CRCP5301 
Each folder contains a specific element of the game. 
The code is hosted on the AGS editor itself but is uploaded to Itch.io and can be downloaded there.
A limitation of AGS is that the games made on it are for Windows users.


The game art was created using Pixilart.com and so the pixil files can be edited using the website. 
AGS uses Java and C++ as a scripting language.
The music in the game was used with due credit given.
